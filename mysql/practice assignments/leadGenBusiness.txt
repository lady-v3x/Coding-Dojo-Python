1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT 
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM billing.charged_datetime) AS 'month',
SUM(billing.amount) AS revenue
FROM billing
WHERE billing.charged_datetime >= '2012/03/01'
AND billing.charged_datetime < '2012/04/01';

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT clients.client_id,
SUM(billing.amount) AS revenue
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
AND clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT sites.domain_name, clients.client_id
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
AND clients.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?

SELECT clients.client_id,
COUNT(sites.site_id) AS sites_created,
MONTH(sites.created_datetime) AS 'month',
YEAR(sites.created_datetime) AS 'year'
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
AND clients.client_id = 1
GROUP BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime) , YEAR(sites.created_datetime);

SELECT clients.client_id,
COUNT(sites.site_id) AS sites_created,
MONTH(sites.created_datetime) AS 'month',
YEAR(sites.created_datetime) AS 'year'
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
AND clients.client_id = 20
GROUP BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime) , YEAR(sites.created_datetime);

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id)
FROM sites
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN "2011-01-01%" AND "2011-02-15%"
GROUP BY sites.domain_name;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads_genereated
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN "2011-01-01%" AND "2011-12-31%"
GROUP BY clients.first_name;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads_genereated, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, "%M") AS month
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN "2011-01-01%" AND "2011-06-30%"
GROUP BY month, clients.first_name
ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, "%m");

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads_genereated, sites.domain_name
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN "2011-01-01%" AND "2011-12-31%"
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads_genereated, sites.domain_name
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
GROUP BY leads.site_id, sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(billing.amount) AS revenue_collected, MONTH(billing.charged_datetime) AS 'month',YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS 'year'
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id,YEAR(billing.charged_datetime),MONTH(billing.charged_datetime)
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(billing.amount) AS revenue_collected, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, "%M") AS 'month', DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, "%Y") AS 'year'
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id,DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, "%y"),DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, "%m")
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, GROUP_CONCAT(' ', sites.domain_name) AS sites
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id;
